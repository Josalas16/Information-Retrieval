Flights_dataset2_Description
These datasets contain a list of all flights in the US for a given month. 
Each row represents a flight. For each flight, the dataset includes the
date of the flight, the airports of origin and destination, and the number
of passengers in the flight. 

The dataset contains additional information, however, I don't have the slightest
idea of what the rest of the codes mean :/ Hopefully, we won't need them.
