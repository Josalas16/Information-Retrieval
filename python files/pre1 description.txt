This file takes in the COVID_Dataset file and stores the relevant information (i.e the dates and the number of infections per day) into multiple different structures. 

The dates and number of infections are initially stored into a string, then converted to lists and eventually converted into a Pandas DataFrame, which is then exported to seperate csv files. Due to the uncertainty in the needs from the analysis team: each of these structures are left in the file so that the team is able to decide which would be most beneficial for the analysis.
